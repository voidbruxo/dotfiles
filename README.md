# dotfiles 👨🏻‍💻🌟💻
These are my minimal dotfiles that I use daily. They consist of a simple Window Manager (DWM) config that is designed to be minimalistic, without any unnecessary bloatware. It is not intended for ricing, but rather for daily use with low dependencies.

- TL;DR :: Feel free to customize and use these dotfiles according to your needs. 😊
