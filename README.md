# dotfiles 👨🏻‍💻🌟💻
These are my minimal dotfiles that I use daily. They consist of a simple Window Manager (DWM) config that is designed to be minimalistic, without any unnecessary bloatware. It is not intended for ricing, but rather for daily use with low dependencies.

- File Manager: 📁 ranger (I'm not really a FM guy)
- video player : mpv / qmplay2 🎞️

- Editor: ✍️ vim / emacs
- Wallpaper Set: 🖼️ nitrogen / feh
- Run Prompt: 🚀 rofi, 🪟 qtile run, dmenu
